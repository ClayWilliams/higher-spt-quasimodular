# higher-spt-quasimodular
A Mathematica notebook giving the expansion of the higher-order smallest parts functions spt4 and spt5 in a quasimodular basis.

The aim of this notebook is to prove the quasimodular expanisons of the generating functions for spt4, spt5 as seen in Lemma 3.6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04909.
